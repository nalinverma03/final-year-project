# final-year-project

## Overview
A project aimed at helping students visualize parsing algorithms. This tool provides an interactive way to understand complex parsing techniques by breaking them into manageable steps. It is designed to assist students in learning and debugging parsing processes effectively.

## Features
- **Dynamic Tree Visualization:** Builds trees that dynamically update based on the current step in the parsing process.
- **Stack Visualizer:** Displays the state of the stack at each step, helping users understand how data is processed.
- **Backtracking Support:** Allows users to enable support for backtracking.
- **Step-by-Step Execution:** Allows users to execute parsing algorithms step-by-step for better comprehension.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design to make learning parsing algorithms accessible to everyone.

## Setup
Instructions to set up the project locally:

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Disclaimer:** Ensure you use the correct command path for Python. On Mac, the default command is often `python3` instead of `python`.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- HTTP Server for frontend
- Parsing algorithms and visualization libraries
